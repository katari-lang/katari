// The execution layer: the instance envelope + its kind extensions (`core_instances` /
// `external_call_instances`), the request/capability edges (delegations, escalations), and the API's
// per-run management record (runs + escalations audit). The instance is class-table inheritance — a
// generic envelope (the ownership / cascade / load unit) plus a kind-specific extension keyed by it; an
// in-flight external call is an external-kind instance with an `external_call_instances` row, not a
// per-kind `*_calls` table.
//
// An instance is ephemeral: it self-deletes at its terminal (the project cascade is only a crash
// backstop), and terminal outcomes live on `runs`, not here. The parent→child edge is the `delegations`
// row, not a column on the instance — a child carries only its `delegation_id` (which correlates its
// `delegateAck`, e.g. when one parent runs several delegates in parallel), and the parent is recovered
// through `delegations.caller_instance_id`. A `core` instance's `target` holds the agent reference
// `(qname, snapshot) | closure`; its `snapshotId` is the version denormalised out of it for the FK.
//
// Snapshot retention: a *running* core activation pins its version by FK (`core_instances.snapshot_id`,
// ON DELETE NO ACTION) — that, plus `projects.head_snapshot_id`, is what keeps a live snapshot
// undeletable. An external call's snapshot id rides inside its extension document as plain data (a future
// snapshot GC must consult live external calls, not just FKs). A finished run's `runs.snapshotId` is only
// audit, so it is ON DELETE SET NULL: it must NOT keep every version a run ever touched alive forever, or
// future snapshot GC could never reclaim anything.
