// Thread: the execution unit of the engine. Stored as plain data
// (tagged union) so Immer can update it structurally and the snapshot
// layer can serialize it without OO ceremony.
//
// Each variant carries:
//   - `kind`: discriminator
//   - common fields: id / parent / parentCallId / scopeId / status / children / askIdMap
//   - variant-specific fields (pc, blockId, etc.)
//
// All operations on threads live in `engine/thread/ops/`. Threads are
// **never** mutated in place after construction; engine code produces a
// new Thread record (via Immer or explicit spread) when state changes.
